# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Since this is Passive Queue, "changes" might be a strong word.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-12

### Added

### Changed
- Everything and nothing simultaneously

- The need for Redis/PostgreSQL/external dependencies

### Performance
